# Signate Digital Signage Platform - Enhancement Approach

## Project Overview

This documentation collection outlines the **Enhancement Approach** for transforming the existing Anthias digital signage backend into a scalable B2B SaaS multi-tenant platform while preserving all existing functionality and ensuring zero-downtime migration.

## Approach Summary

**Strategy**: Fork and enhance the proven Anthias (Screenly OSE) backend + build modern Next.js frontend
**Timeline**: 8-10 months with quality-focused development
**Team**: 1 Backend Developer, 2 Frontend Developers, 1 DevOps Engineer

### Why Enhancement vs Greenfield?

- ‚úÖ **Proven Foundation**: Anthias is the world's most popular open-source digital signage platform
- ‚úÖ **Faster Time-to-Market**: Build on existing functionality rather than recreating from scratch
- ‚úÖ **Risk Mitigation**: Preserve existing working system while adding new capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Community Support**: Leverage existing documentation, community, and ecosystem
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users can seamlessly upgrade
