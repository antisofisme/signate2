## Team Coordination Protocol

### Concurrent Agent Execution
Each phase utilizes Claude Code's Task tool for parallel development:

```javascript
// Standard Phase Pattern
[Phase X Implementation - Single Message]:
  Task("Specialist 1", "Detailed task description...", "agent-type")
  Task("Specialist 2", "Detailed task description...", "agent-type")
  Task("Specialist 3", "Detailed task description...", "agent-type")

  TodoWrite { todos: [...8-12 phase-specific todos...] }

  // Parallel file operations
  Read "files-to-analyze"
  Write "new-files-required"
  MultiEdit "files-to-update"
```

### Coordination Hooks
Each agent MUST use coordination hooks:

```bash
# Before work
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Phase X task"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "signage-enhancement"

# During work
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "path/to/file" --memory-key "phase/progress"

# After completion
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "phase-x-completion"
```

### Weekly Rhythm
- **Monday**: Phase planning and dependency review
- **Wednesday**: Progress checkpoint and blocker resolution
- **Friday**: Phase completion review and next phase preparation

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase must achieve:
- All deliverables completed and tested
- Quality gates passed
- Documentation updated
- Stakeholder sign-off received

### Final Project Success
- Zero-downtime migration from existing Anthias
- >90% test coverage across all components
- Performance targets met (<200ms API response)
- Security audit passed with zero critical issues
- 100% backward compatibility maintained

This implementation roadmap ensures systematic, risk-managed transformation of Anthias into a enterprise-grade SaaS platform while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining operational continuity.
